- ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Audrey! I'm finishing up my degree at the University of Alabama in May 2024 and will begin an online Master's in Computer Science (with concentrations in Big Data and Machine Learning) from UC Boulder in the fall.
- ðŸ’¼ I'm searching for remote jobs (or hybrid options in Tuscaloosa or Birmingham, Alabama) in data or artificial intelligence. I have two years of experience in internships, research, and full-time work using tools like Python, Excel, and Power BI---I'd be happy to send over my resume if you or someone you know is hiring in those areas!
- âœ… I have the following industry-recognized certifications: Microsoft Azure Data Scientist Associate (DP-100) Professional Certificate, Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, Microsoft Office Specialist: Excel Associate Certificate, and IBM Applied AI Certificate.

- ðŸ‘€ Most of my Github repositories contain small projects that answer a fun question of mine :)
- âš¡ And a little fun fact as a treat: in my free time, I play piano, flute, guitar, bass, and cello!
